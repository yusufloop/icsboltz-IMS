# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## ðŸŽ¨ Premium Design System

This app features a comprehensive design system called "Effortless Premium" inspired by Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. The design philosophy focuses on:

- **Clean & Intuitive**: Meticulous use of space, typography, and subtle interactions
- **High Quality**: Premium feel through attention to detail
- **Consistent**: Unified color palette, spacing, and component styling
- **Accessible**: Strong contrast ratios and readable typography

### Design System Features

- **Color Palette**: Primary action blue (#0A84FF), semantic status colors, and carefully chosen backgrounds
- **Typography**: System font stack with proper hierarchy and line heights
- **Spacing**: 4px grid system for consistent layouts
- **Components**: Premium buttons, cards, inputs, and status badges
- **Animations**: Subtle micro-interactions and purposeful motion
- **Gradients**: Tasteful gradients for CTAs and decorative elements
- **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass effects for overlays and modals

### Component Library

- `PremiumButton` - Animated buttons with multiple variants
- `PremiumCard` - Elevated cards with shadow and glass variants
- `PremiumInput` - Animated form inputs with focus states
- `PremiumStatusBadge` - Status indicators with semantic colors
- `PremiumGradientBackground` - Gradient containers

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
